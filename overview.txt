The lesson will begin with a brief introduction to Heaney's life, including his upbringing in rural Northern Ireland and his experiences during the Troubles. Students will then engage in small-group discussions to analyze selected poems by Heaney, exploring the themes of identity, violence, nature, and memory in his work. Through close reading and analysis, students will gain insight into Heaney's use of poetic devices and his unique style. The lesson will culminate with individual reflections, where students will respond to one of Heaney's poems, connecting it to their own lives and experiences. By the end of the lesson, students will have developed a deeper appreciation for Heaney's poetry and an understanding of the historical and cultural context that influenced his work.
